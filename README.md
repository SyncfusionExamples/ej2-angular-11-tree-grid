## Features and Benefits

### Column

Columns define the schema of a data source in Angular Tree Grid. Features include formatting, column definitions, text wrapping, column chooser, column menu, column reordering, and other important features.

### Paging

Through [paging](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/treegrid/paging?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=angular-tree-grid-github-samples), a segment of data can be viewed from the assigned data source. The Angular Tree Grid offers built-in pager UI with options to customize its entire UI. It also has an on-demand paging mode for effective data retrieval from remote web services.

### Sorting

The Angular Tree Grid allows users to sort a column by simply clicking on the header. A Ctrl + header click performs multi-sorting. Sort data in either ascending or descending order.

### Filtering

Filtering helps view specific or related records that meet a given filtering criteria. It supports various filter types that include powerful Excel-like filter. The Angular Tree Grid filter allows users to choose appropriate filter types, define their own custom filtering logic, and customize the filtering UI based on their application needs. Filtering with related parent or child records can be defined.

### Selection

Angular Tree Grid allows selecting rows or cells. One or more rows or cells can also be selected by holding Ctrl or Command, or programmatically.
